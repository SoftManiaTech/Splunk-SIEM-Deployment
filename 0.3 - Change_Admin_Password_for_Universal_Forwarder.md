## In Universal Forwarder

Rename the existing password file to different one

```bash
sudo su - splunk 

cd /opt/splunkforwarder/etc

mv passwd passwd.bkp
```

Create a new user-seed.conf with the user admin

```bash
cd /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local

vi user-seed.conf
```

```bash
[user_info]
USERNAME = admin
PASSWORD = newpassword
```

Restart the Splunk Universal Forwarder to make the changes reflect

```bash
/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk restart
```
